            I happened to be reading an online article about the official<a href="http://www.ropltribune.org/Archive/1926/March/March,%2016%201926.pdf"> opening of St. Mary High School </a>(March 17, 1926).  After reading the article about the new and modern high school I wondered "How did the football team do that year?" Turns out they didn't start playing football until 1927.  I quickly found a new hobby for myself - going through each season chronicling how the team had done.  It was a fun research project that seemed to fit well with my retirement and combined a couple of topics I have always found interesting - <strong>History and Football</strong>.  Using the <a href="http://www.ropltribune.org/">Royal Oak Daily Tribune Online Archives</a> as the main source of information, I went through each season beginning in 1927 through the final season in 1984 (I'm still working on the 1980s).  It was very interesting to go through each year finding the articles on the team, but also reading about the changes to the South Oakland County (SOC) area.  After gathering the information I developed a simple website to display the articles and pictures, creating a digital scrap book of St. Mary's Football.  <br><br>
