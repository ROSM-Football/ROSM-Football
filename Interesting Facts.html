                  <ul class>
                    <li>St. Mary's first season was in 1927.  The school joined the Detroit Catholic League in 1928.</li>
                    <li>St. Mary's won or shared the Catholic League Championship 6 times - 1931, 1934, 1935, 1946, 1948 and 1976.</li>
                    <li>Home games were played at the following fields:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cass Field/Royal Oak Dondero High School</strong>  - 1927-47, 1951, 1969-1984 </li>
                        <li><strong>Memorial Park</strong> - 1948-49, 1952-1968 </li>
                        <li><strong>Angell Field</strong> in Berkley - 1950 </li>
                        <li><strong>Royal Oak Kimball High School</strong> - this field was used occasionally in the 70's</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In the early years the team practiced at the field across from the high school - where the current Grade School and Church reside. </li>
                    <li>St. Mary's produced two undefeated football teams: <strong>The 1946 Champions</strong> with a 9-0 record; <strong>The 1931 Champions</strong> with a 6-0-3 record. </li> 
                    <li>St. Mary's played on Thanksgiving Day twice - beating Madison in 1930 and playing to a tie with St. Benedict in 1931.</li>  
                    <li>Jimmy Collins is the only player to be selected to the Detroit Free Press First Team All-Catholic - he was selected in both 1933 and 1934.  In addition, Collins was in the first game photo of a St. Mary's football game in 1934. Click <a href="images/1934 First Game Photo.jpg"> here </a> to see the photo.</li>              
                    <li>The Daily Tribune did not use the “Irish” nickname until 1940.  Prior to '40 the paper often referred to the team as the “Royal Oakers”.</li>   
                    <li>St. Mary's played for the Brown Jug against Madison Hts. Madison and the Green Jug against Ferndale St. James.</li>   
                    <li>Although St. James dominated the series with St. Mary's, the Irish at one time had a great winning streak against the Dales - going 7-1-1 from 1946 until 1954.</li>            
                    <li>St. Mary's played Royal Oak High twice - losing in both 1934 and 1935.  The Royal Oak High Team of 1935 was the Class A State Champions.</li>
                    <li>In 1938 there was a plan to place flood lights at the Athletic Field on the north-west corner of Lafayette and Lincoln - the present site of St. Mary's Church.  Click <a href="Floodlights.html"> here </a> to read the article.</li>
                    <li>The 1946 Catholic League 2nd Division championship team included a WWII service veteran, <strong>Mike Lesko.</strong>  This is an interesting story - click <a href="MikeLesko.html"> here </a> to read about Mike Lesko.</li>
                    <li>The 1948 team 2nd Division Co-Champions had 5 sets of brothers and the 1976 2nd Divion Champions had 4 set of brothers playing on the team.</li>
                    <li>A little controversy with the 1934 and 1948 championship teams:</li>
                    <ul>
                       <li>The 1934 team had beaten St. James to take sole possession of first place.  However, shortly after the game a player was discovered to be ineligible.  St. Mary's forfeited the game and ended up in tie for the league title with St. James.  The Daily Tribune reported on Nov 21 that St. Mary's wanted to recognize St. James as the sole champion.  Nonetheless, the Detroit Catholic League (on their website) recognizes St. Mary as the 2nd Division Champion for 1934.    </li>
                       <li>The 1948 team tied Detroit St. Martin of Tours in the championship game.  Apparently, there had been an agreement that in the event of a tie the team with the most yards gained would be crowned champion.  St. Martin had gained 12 more yards than St. Mary, but as Coach Joey Smith said later at the team banquet "co-champions" was a fairer way - St. Mary's earned the co-championship!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Al Chevalier holds distinction of being the first coach to be a member of the St. Mary's faculty staff <strong>and </strong>having the shortest tenure as coach - 3 games in the 1952 season.   </li>
                    <li>Joey Smith and Ken Wright had the longest tenure as coach - both coached the Irish in 5 seasons and won a 2nd Division Championship (Smith in '48 and Wright in '76).</li>
                    <li>St. Mary's had five alumni serve as head football coach - Paul Janness ('30), Frank Buchanan ('34), Ted Klapperich ('41), Ed Casey ('49) and Ken Wright ('66).</li>
                    <li>In the 1920s and '30s High School Football results were often front-page news in the Daily Tribune.  Click <a href="frontpage.html"> here </a>to see an example. </li>
                    <li>Beginning in the 1920s through the mid '60s the Daily Tribune often printed the starting lineup for each game.  If you look through articles and read those starting lineups you might find familiar family names.  Click <a href="lineups.html"> here </a>to see some examples.  </li>
