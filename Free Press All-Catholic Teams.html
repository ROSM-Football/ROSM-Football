       <h1> Detroit Free Pree All-Catholic Football Teams</h1><br>
         <h3>Beginning in the late 1920's and through the mid 1990's, the Detroit Free Press published an annual All-Catholic Football Team.  The all-star team was was comprised of players in the Detroit Catholic League and it usually came out in mid to late November.  At it's peak in the 1960's, the Detroit Catholic League had nearly 70 teams.  Although smaller today with 33 teams, it is still the largest Catholic High School league in the US.

            Below is a look back at the Detroit Free Press All-Catholic Football teams through the years.  There were a few seasons that could not be located (1929, '31, '32, '47 and '67), but it's still an interesting look back at all the Catholic schools in Metro Detroit.
