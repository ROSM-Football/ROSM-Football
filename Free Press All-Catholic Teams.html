       <h1> Detroit Free Pree All-Catholic Football Teams</h1><br>
         <h2>Beginning in the late 1920's through the mid 1990's the Detroit Free Press published an annual All-Catholic Football Team. <br>
             There are a few seasons that could not be located (1931, 1932 and 1947), but it's an interesting look back at all the Catholic schools in Metro Detroit.</h2>
