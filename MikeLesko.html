         In August 1945, <b>Mike Lesko</b> forgoes his Senior year at St. Mary's and enlisted into the Navy.  With the military winding down at the end of the war, Lesko is eventually discharged and enrolled at St. Mary's in the fall of 1946 for his senior year.  At the time the MHSAA allowed teams to have players up to the age of 19 years old. <br><br>     

         Lesko joined a talented team that fall. Coach Tom Dorais was quoted as saying the returning service veteran was "one of the hardest working" members of the team. Lesko was the starting left end in football and center for the Irish basketball team.  He was the top scorer on 1947 basketball Catholic League Championship team and was selcted to the All-SOC (South Oakland County) Basketball team in 1947.  <br><br> 

         Mike went to serve with distinction in the Korean War. See the article below where he received his medals in 1980, some 28 years after serving! He was the long-time Personnel Director for the City of Royal Oak. He also designed the city seal for Royal Oak in 1965. Mike retired in 1987 and interestingly, <b>Ralph Sherman</b>,  St. Mary graduate Class of '52, took his place as the Personnel Director! <br><br> 

         I hope you find the articles below an interesting read.
