         Mike Lesko was a key contributor to St. Mary's Catholic League championship seasons in 1946 and 1947 in both football and basketball. <br><br> In the summer of 1945 Mike Lesko forgoes his Senior year at St. Mary's and enlisted into the Army. An August 7, 1945 Daily Tribune article detailed a farewell party attended by several classmates.  Apparently, he is discharged and is able to enroll at St. Mary's in the fall of 1946.  At the time high school athletes were eligible to play until they reached the age of 20. The 19-year-old Lesko joined a talented team that fall.  Coach Tom Dorais was quoted as saying the returning  service veteran Mike Lesko was "one of the hardest working" members of the team. Lesko was the starting left end in football and center and top scorer in 1947 for the Irish basketball team. He made the All-SOC (South Oakland County) Basketball team in 1947.  After graduating from St. Mary's he attended Wayne State. <br><br>
 
          
         Mike went to serve with distinction in the Korean War. See the article below where he received his medals in 1980 - 28 years after serving! He was the long-time Personnel Director for the City of Royal Oak.  He also designed the city seal for Royal Oak in 1965.  Mike retired in 1987 - interestingly, Ralph Sherman (another St. Mary graduate) took his place as the Personnel Director!  I hope you find the articles below an interesting read.
