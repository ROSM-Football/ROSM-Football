        <h1> 1930 St. Mary's Yearbook</h1><br>
        <h3>I found a copy of the 1930 Yearbook titled "The Maria" at the Royal Oak library.  I copied several pages and thought it was interesting to look back at the early years of Royal Oak St. Mary High School.  Note -  Miss Sara Bean on the faculty staff.  I believe this may be Tom Bean's sister.</h3> <br>
