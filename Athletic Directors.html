                   A good Athletic Director is essential for any high school. While there had been several ADs over the course of the 57-year history of St. Mary High School football, I believe there were three men who had a significant impact on athletics and the student athletes.  St. Mary's was blessed to have these men who were a strong and influential Athletic Directors - <strong>Fr. Richard Noon, Tom Bean</strong> and <strong> Phil Young</strong>.       <br><br>
          
         
                   <strong>Fr. Richard Noon</strong> - Fr. Noon was a newly ordained priest when he arrived at St. Mary's in 1929 - his first parish assignment.  He was instrumental in setting up the first athletic program at St. Mary's. Fr. Noon helped to usher St. Mary's into the competitive Detroit Catholic League while he coached football, basketball and baseball.  He was the first football coach to win a Catholic League Championship in 1931.  He took the 1930 basketball team to the Catholic League Championship (losing in the final) and was Athletic Director when they won the football and basketball Catholic League Championships in 1934.  He spent 5 years at St. Mary's, leaving in August of 1934 for a new assignment at Mt. Clemens St. Peters.  Reading the 1930 St. Mary's Yearbook and the Daily Tribune articles gives you the sense he was well respected by the parents and revered by his students.  Sadly, Fr. Noon passed away in 1937 at the age of 34.   Click <a href="Fr Richard Noon.html"> here </a>to read more on Fr. Richard Noon. <br> <br>
         
                   <strong>Tom Bean</strong> - Although he was the head coach of St. Mary's High School football for just one season (1945), there was no one who had a greater impact on St. Mary's athletics than Tom Bean.  According to articles in the Daily Tribune, Mr. Bean began working at newly opened St. Mary High School in 1926 because he was the only one who knew how to take care of the 4 bowling alleys in the basement!  There were differing accounts when he began as Athletic Director (either 1935 or 1938). He held either the AD or assistant AD job for close to 40 years.  He coached football, baseball and basketball teams at both the High School and Grade School.  Mr. Bean was very successful coach - his basketball teams won back-to-back Catholic League Championships in 1946-47 and again in the early 1950's.

                  <strong>Phil Young</strong> joined the St. Mary's faculty in the mid-1960's.  Those who took his French class should fondly remember the phrase "écoutez et répétez". While he was an assistant JV Football coach in 1965, most of his coaching at St. Mary's was on the hard court. He was he head basketball coach for 7 years and took on the Athletic Director position after Tom Bean retired in 1972.  Mr. Young is remembered as a dedicated teacher, coach and Athletic Director who loved working at St. Mary's.  He was still the Athletic Director when he passed away in June of 1983.
